## Introduction to Sensors - data, examples, and exercises

### Time series modeling exercise

[Example models and data](30mhz)

Create a model based on one of four available example models, or you create a new model from scratch. 

Use at least two sensors to predict the output of one other sensor.

### Micropython Lunar Lander filter exercise

[Micropython Unicorn basic filter example](micropython)

One of the main differences of coding for an MCU is that they offer very few resources. It is generally not possible to use large Python libraries such Numpy or Scipy.

The Lunar Lander assignment requires you to implement a filter while working around these limits.

### MQTT mini-exercise

[MQTT chat](mqtt)

A minimal MQTT chat example. Run it, and chat with your follow students. Feel creative? Work together with your team, let one of your team publish data and another(s) receive data, respectively generated by and analyzed with https://github.com/jmaces/statstream

### Scailable edge computing exercise

[Scailable 101](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/blob/master/sclbl-101-getting-started/README.md)

Time left? Help us out, and test drive our Scailable platform! Just follow the [Scailable 101](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/blob/master/sclbl-101-getting-started/README.md) to get started!
